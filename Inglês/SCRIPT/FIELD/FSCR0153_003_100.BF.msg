[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]I wonder if there's something special[n]about it. Should we take a closer look[n]just in case?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 3 1 65535 0][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]That, Panther, was a rare Shadow that[n]occasionally resides in pricey items. I call[n]them [clr 2]Treasure Demons[clr 27].[n][w][e]
[s][f 4 10 65535 0 0][f 4 25 1 65535 0 0]They're great. Not only do they give you[n]a lot of experience, they might be useful[n]for your Personas too.[n][w][e]

[s]Sometimes [clr 2]Treasure Demons[clr 27] will be hidden[n]inside destructible objects within the Palaces.[n][w][e]
[s]Defeating them will give you a lot of experience[n]points. They also make excellent Persona fusion[n]material.[n][w][e]
[s]It is highly recommended that you actively[n]pursue them any time you come across one.[n][w][e]
