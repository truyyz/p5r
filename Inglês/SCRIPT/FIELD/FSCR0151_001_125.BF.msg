[s][bup 0 4 0 65535 0]So, we just walk in?[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 2 0 65535 0]Dude, a phantom thief never goes in[n]the front door.[n][w][e]

[s]We'll sneak in. There's a secret entrance.[e]
[s]We'll teach you the ropes.[e]

[s][bup 0 4 0 65535 0]Sneak in...? Oh yeah, I guess going in the[n]front door would be pretty dangerous.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_selA_0_m_2 [Ryuji]]
[s][bup 0 2 0 65535 0]Yup, that's what it means to be a phantom[n]thief. You better remember that.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_selA_1_m [Ryuji]]
[s][bup 0 2 0 65535 0]That's right. It's a special way in we found[n]before.[n][w][e]

[s][bup 0 4 0 65535 0]Huh. I guess going in the front door[n]would be pretty dangerous.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_selA_2_m [Ryuji]]
[s][bup 0 2 0 65535 0]That's right. Not bargin' in through the[n]entrance is one of the basics of bein' a[n]thief.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_mes03 [Morgana]]
[s][bup 0 3 3 65535 0]Hold on a second... I'm the one who[n]taught you two about that.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_mes04 [Ryuji]]
[s][bup 0 2 0 65535 0]Uhh, don't worry 'bout that.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e159_010_mes05 [Ann]]
[s][bup 0 4 0 65535 0]Wow... You guys really are phantom[n]thieves.[n][w][e]

[msg D01_04_e160_021_AF_mes01]
[s]It seems as though this[n]door won't open...[n][w][e]
[s]We should probably use[n]another way to sneak in...[n][w][e]
